# Cat-Animation
Screensaver WIP - A cute lil animation of a cat that moves around the screen with a color changing background. 

This project uses a timer listener and coordinate functions to bounce a cat around a full screen JFrame. Uses a random number applied to RGB values to generate a changing background, and a key listener to exit with esc.
